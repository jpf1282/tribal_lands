# Location of master datasets, just in case you need to load them:
    - R_Analysis/processed_data.RData
    - R_Analysis/change_scores_centriod_dist_tribes_level.csv
    - R_Analysis/change_scores_centroid_dist_records_level.csv

# Location of statistical analyses
 - All analyses are in the `R_Analysis/_Statistical_Analysis`
        + Because there are so many SHELDUS files, I moved them to their own folder
 - "_Supplemental" folder is duplicative analysis from a professional statistician. Not all of our variables are included in this folder, but some are. Once we decide on what are the most interesting and important findings, we can use this code to run additional checks. For example, this supplemental folder doesn't include analysis on SHELDUS data, so we can plug it in once we figure out what direction we're headed. 

# What we need to write the paper
 1. Identify statistically significant findings. And any other interesting patterns. Organize into some sort table that we can refer to as I write, and will give us a birds-eye-view of what we've found, and what we want to include in the paper. Perhaps create a new google doc for all of this
 2. Very straightforward explanations for me to use as I write paper. Essentially, explain the different findings in a way that I can copy and paste into the paper (e.g. ANOVA significance means *this*, the linear mixed model significance means *this*, etc.). I'll put most of my energy into thinking about how to frame the paper and make our arguments, so it will be SUPER helpful to not have to go back and look through statistical textbooks, etc, to explain the diff statistical methods. Fortunately, ANOVA and the linear mixed model are pretty basic approaches. Plus, its probably good professional practice for you. :-)
 3. The statistical analysis is pretty rigorous, but be on the lookout for any errors. We'll be posting our code and data, so will be good to double check things. 

# Maps_&_Viz
 - This folder has awesome (1) Coxcomb, and (2) Migration Maps
 - Once we figure out our primary variables, we'll create the coxcomb and the maps that support our statistical findings. The possibilities are somewhat endless with the maps (and to some extent the Coxcomb), so we should be guided by our main findings. 
 - I'll create these maps after Katie is done with the analysis.
