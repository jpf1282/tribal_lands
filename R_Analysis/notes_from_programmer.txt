Below is a summary of the changes:


Size of node in time 1 now correspond to time 1 amenity score. It will show the average amenity rank for all time 1 locations for that tribe when plot using the tribe t1 to record t2 data.frame - "merged_data_tr1_r2_long" and show the amenity rank at time 1 for that location when using the all pairwise migrations between t1 and t2 data.frame - "merged_data_record_all_long"

I added a circle_size parameter to the map_tribe function for you to control the size of the node. You can set the min and max circle size like so circle_size = c(min, max) - example circle_size = c(2, 8)



Update readOGR code


Add code to make a new data.frame to use for mapping all pairwise migrations between t1 and t2 - "merged_data_record_all_long"


4a) Add county boundaries layer to the map_tribe wrapper function. You can toggle it on or off. It is set to only show county boundaries in states where the selected tribes live in time 2.

4b) Add pop-up label to show Tribe name, Time, and Amenity Rank Score when you click on the node. The leaflet package in R does not have a n option for hover pop-up, that's why the pop-up label requires a mouse-click action to trigger.
