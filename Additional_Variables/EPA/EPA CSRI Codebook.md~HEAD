EPA Climate Resilience Screening Index (CSRI)

Details available at: https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P100SSN6.txt

FIPS codes were matched using a package in R, and for those ~100 counties that were not matched in this way, they were manually identified using the following USDA website: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697




"ÄúRisk"Äù: "...Represents the characteristics of a place that contribute to a level of exposure or loss resulting from specific hazards (Climatic events, e.g., sea level rise, hurricane, tornado, wildfire, drought, etc.)"Äù (35). The risk variable is based on an exposure index (which accounts for the probability of earthquakes, floods, hailstorms, hurricanes, landslides, tornados, wildfires, and accounts of extreme temperatures and damaging winds) and a loss index (taken directly from the SHELDUS database).

"Governance"Äù: "...describes the collaboration of government agencies and Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) or private actors (e.g., companies, citizens, etc.) toward joint objectives within a system of rules and regulations"Äù (37). This variable combines indicators of community preparedness, personal preparedness, and natural resource conservation.

"Society": "...includes all human aspects of a community except the built environment. These are the constructs that represent the economic, demographic, and social interactions common to all urban and rural populations"Äù (39). Includes measures of demographics, economic diversity, health characteristics, labor and trade services, safety and security, social cohesion, social services, and socio-economics as indicators.

"Built Environment": "...describes the man-made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity, ranging in scale from buildings and green spaces to neighborhoods and cities"Äù (43). Includes communications infrastructure, housing characteristics, transportation infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, and vacant structures.

"ÄúNatural Environment": "...a domain that encompasses all living and nonliving things, occurring naturally in the United States"Äù (46). Includes spatial extent of "nonhuman" ecosystems (wetlands, forests, deserts, aquatic areas, grasslands, tundra) and land condition.

"NRCS_CountyName": For those counties which were manually matched to a FIPS code, and which had a different name listed in the USDA webpage, the second name is listed in this column.
